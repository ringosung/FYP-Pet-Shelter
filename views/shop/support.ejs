                <h2>Here are some post-adoption tips to help you and your pet adjust to your new life together:</h2>

                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Give your pet time to adjust: It's normal for pets to feel a bit anxious or overwhelmed during their first few days in a new home. Give them some space and time to explore their new surroundings at their own pace.</li>
                    <li>Establish a routine: Pets thrive on routine, so establish a consistent schedule for feeding, exercise, and playtime. This will help your pet feel more secure and settled in their new home.</li>
                    <li>Provide plenty of exercise and mental stimulation: Regular exercise and playtime are essential for your pet's physical and mental health. Make sure they have plenty of opportunities to run, play, and explore.</li>
                    <li>Stick to a healthy diet: Feeding your pet a healthy, balanced diet is important for their overall health and well-being. Consult with your veterinarian to determine the best type and amount of food for your pet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Keep up with veterinary care: Regular check-ups and vaccinations are essential for your pet's health. Make sure to schedule annual veterinary visits, and seek medical attention if your pet shows any signs of illness or injury.
                    </li>
                    <li>Train your pet: Training is an important part of pet ownership, and can help prevent behavioral issues down the road. Start with basic obedience training, and consider enrolling your pet in a training class.
                    </li>
                    <li>Show plenty of love and affection: Pets thrive on love and attention, so make sure to show your furry friend plenty of affection and praise. This will help strengthen the bond between you and your pet.
                    </li>
                </ol>
 
                <p>Remember, every pet is unique and may have their own specific needs and quirks. Be patient and attentive to your pet's individual personality and needs, and you'll have a happy and healthy pet for years to come!</p>

    <h2>Get to grips with the basics</h2>

<p>Our guides can help you with the basics of how to train your dog, but we also recommend <a href="/adviceandwelfare/pets/dogs/training/trainer">dog training classes</a> - especially for more advanced methods, such as clicker training.</p>

<p>If you have any problems, try asking a <a href="/adviceandwelfare/pets/general/findabehaviourist">qualified behaviourist</a> for advice. They specialise in behavioural issues such as excessive barking, aggression, destructiveness and phobias. You can also enlist the help of a dog training instructor if you need a bit of extra help.</p>
